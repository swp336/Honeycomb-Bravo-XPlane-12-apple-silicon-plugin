HoneycombOnArm64MacOS

This is an X-Plane 12 Apple Silicon plug-in for the Honeycomb Bravo Throttle.  It supports configuration of the rotary controls, the switches, the autopilot buttons, the button lights and the annunciator lights.  

The Bravo switches can be configured to modfify the rotary and button behaviours, enabling different 'banks' of control mappings to be selected in flight, thus supporting a much wider range of aircraft control than a simple 1-1 mapping of button-to-command.

Configurations are supplied for all the Laminar Research aircraft, plus (vBeta1.01) the Zibo 737-800X.  These are created as json files when the plug-in first runs. Users can modify the default throttle behaviour if they are brave enough to edit json files.

Full installation, configuration and users guides are included.

Requires MacOS Sonoma and Apple Silicon CPU
